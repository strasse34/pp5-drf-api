## Technologies Used

### Languages & Frameworks

- Python 3.10.2
- Django
- Django Rest Framework

### Libraries & Tools

- [Cloudinary](https://cloudinary.com/) to store images for profile and events
- [CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com/) was used for validation of python files.
- [Lucidcharts](https://lucid.app/) has been used in project to design and document data model architecture.
- [CodeAnyWhere](https://app.codeanywhere.com/) was IDE used for writing code and to push the code to GitHub
- [GitHub](https://github.com/) was used as a remote repository to store project code
- [Heroku](https://heroku.com) - Cloud platform. Justification: I used this was used to deploy the project into live environment
- [Django REST Framework](https://www.django-rest-framework.org/) - API toolkit. Justification: I used this to build the back-end API
- [Django AllAuth](https://django-allauth.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html) - API Module. Justification: I used this for user authentication
- [Psycopg2](https://www.psycopg.org/docs/) - PostgreSQL database adaptor. Justification: This was used as a PostgreSQL database adapter for Python
- [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com/) - Database hosting service â€“ Justification: This was used as the deployed project on Heroku uses an ElephantSQL database

### All libraries for deployment in Heroku

- All libraries is stored in requirements.txt for deployment in heroku

## Agile design

### User Story Template

- Using Github issues first I created the template for a user story that was later used to create user stories. I created four labels: must have, could have, should have.

### Kanban Board

- As a visual representation of the project's status, showing what tasks are to be done, in progress and completed.Each task is represented as a card on the board, and the cards can be moved from one column to another to show progress.

### Milestones

- Milestones are created with a aim of finishing a task on a certain date. I have created 7 milestones for this project and linked them with issues related.

## Database Design

---

<details><summary>(ERD)Physical database model</summary>
<img src="images/database-diagram.png">
</details>

- This sample ERD diagram was made using [Lucid Charts](https://www.lucidchart.com)
- For this Django app I have used PostgreSQL relational database management system.
- model showed on the diagram visually represents the structure of a PostgreSQL database, including tables, columns, relationships, and constraints, that is stored in the database itself.

### Data Models

#### User Model

- User model as part of the Django Rest Framework dj-rest-auth library contains basic information about authenticated user and contains folowing fields:
